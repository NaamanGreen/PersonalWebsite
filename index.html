					<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
					<p>The highlight of a great program at Brandeis University was the capstone project.  I thoroughly enjoyed going through the SDLC with my team.  From reviewing requirements
					and planning stories, to writing code and creating a test suite, there were opportunities to learn at every turn.  I'm looking forward to continuing that journey.

					<h3>BI Developer & Analyst</h3>
					<p>As a BI developer, I was deep in relational databases on a day to day basis.  I have extensive experience with SQL Server, SQL Server Reporting Services, and MySQL.
					My time as a BI developer and analyst has given me great perspective on how to model, capture, and normalize data.  
					</p>

					<h3>Continous Learning</h3>
					<p>I was very excited when MOOCs started to become popular.  Before pursuing my master's, I took courses through Coursera and edX in technologies like Java, Python, and R.  
					Since completing my degree, I've finished a specialization in JavaScript and look forward to seeing what other topics I can explore.
					</p>

					<h3>Mentoring</h3>
					<p>I'd love to have a chance to develop into a role where I could help those around me.  I've learned a lot from mentors that have become long-time friends and, more recently,
					a long-time friend that has become a mentor.  I know the benefits of having great mentors in your corner, and I'd like to pay that forward.

				<h2>Board Game Data (V1)</h2>
				<p>During July of 2021 I started studying Stephen Grider's <i>Modern React with Redux</i> course at Udemy. I took a brief pause to start this project.</p>
				<p>This React application uses Board Game Atlas's API to return board games that match the user's search.  Results are displayed in a list form
				with preliminary data, and more information is displayed for the selected board game.</p>
				<p>I have plans for expanding the application as I learn more about data persistence options with React.</p>

				<h2>Personal Website</h2>
				<p>You're looking at it!</p>
				<p>I started this project in June of 2021 after completing a JavaScript specialization offered by UC Davis through Coursera.</p>
				<p>In addition to giving some background about myself, it also showcases some of the JS and jQuery interactivty that was covered
				in the course, including smooth scrolling, sliders, and tabs.</p>
				<p>While responsive design wasn't covered explicitly, I was able to apply the same principles the instructor implemented in the 
				code that was provided before we added the JavaScript.</p>

				<h2>Library Management System</h2>
				<p>This was my capstone project for my master's degree in December of 2020.  The project allowed my team to build
				an application from scratch in an Agile environment.  Technologies used included Java, Spring, MySQL, and GitLab.</p>
				<p>In the video below, which was part of the final assignment, I cover the functionality that I implemented throughout the project.</p>

				<h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
				<p>I created this application in June of 2020 during a break between classes at Brandeis.</p>
				<p>When launched, it provides a simple UI that allows users to enter the digits they're given in a Sudoku puzzle.</p>
				<p>The application uses a brute force algorithm to test possible combinations until a solution is found.  In also includes
				some unit tests using JUnit.</p>
