# PersonalWebsite
My personal website, naamangreen.com.

# Motivation
After finishing William Mead's JavaScript specilization offered by UC Davis/Coursera, I built this website to implement some of the topics covered.
The website also gives me an opportunity to show potential employers some of the technologies I've used, the experience I have, and the projects I've worked on.
